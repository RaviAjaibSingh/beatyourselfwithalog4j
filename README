Steps:

1) Build the java app with
./gradlew distTar

You can change the log4j2 version by modifying app/src/build.gradle where it says:
```
    runtimeOnly group: 'org.apache.logging.log4j', name: 'log4j-slf4j-impl', version: '2.10.0'
```
If you do this, re-run this step and all subsequent steps.

2) Then build the docker container
docker build -f Dockerfile -t beatyourselfwithalog4j/app:latest .

You can modify the Dockerfile to change JDK versions or environment variables.

There are some common ones included (commented out) in the Dockerfile (JDK8/11/17).

If you make this modification, re-run this step and all subsequent steps.

3) Run the container

docker run --network none -it beatyourselfwithalog4j/app:latest

4) You will be prompted to enter a string, that will be logged via log4j2.  Try entering a string like:

${jndi:ldap://localhost:9999}/a

The java process also runs a TCP server at localhost:9999 that will log any inbound connections and print the contents.
